Inflation Rate (CPI) (Canada vs U.S) by Decades
By using Group in Power Query to divide different Time periods, we can get comparision. Forecastnig tool in analytics in Power BI is very strong component, when especially you are working on Time-stamp data. I am using Inflation Rate (CPI) in my work but for seasonal data we can opt seasonality option during forecasting which is so convinient in Power BI.
